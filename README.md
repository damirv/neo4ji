**Introduction**

Neo4ji offers tools for creating and managing multiple local neo4j instances

**About**

I put this together as a convienience utility for spinning up multiple instances of neo4j for testing.  It is built for ease of use in a development setting, and probably should not be considered ready for production.

**Usage**

Neo4ji consists of a command line tool and a node module.  The command line tool has the following options:

create a server with the given name
    $ neo4ji create <server name>

destroy the server with the given name
    $ neo4ji destroy <server name>

start the server with the given name (a new server will be created if none exists)
    $ neo4ji start <server name>

stop the server with the given name
    $ neo4ji stop <server name>

show a list of instances managed by noe4ji
    $ neo4ji instances


The module has the following functions:

    var neo4ji = require('neo4ji')

    //create a server instance called testServer
    neo4ji.create('testServer');

    //start the testServer instance
    neo4ji.start('testServer');

    //get the instances object
    var instances = neo4ji.instances();

    //get a graph server instance for testServer
    var graph = neo4ji.server('testServer');

    //stop the testServer instance
    neo4ji.stop('testServer');

    //destroy the testServer instance
    neo4ji.destroy('testServer');

**Notes on behavior**

- calling 'create' will always create a new instance, overwriting any existing instance
- calling 'start' will create an instance if none exists
- everything is done synchronously
