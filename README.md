**Introduction**

Neo4ji offers tools for creating and managing multiple local neo4j instances

**About**

I put this together as a convienience utility for spinning up multiple instances of neo4j for testing.  It is built for ease of use in a development setting, and probably should not be considered ready for production.

**Installation**

    $ npm install neo4ji

**Usage**

Neo4ji consists of a command line tool and a node module.  The command line tool has the following options:

create a server with the given name

    $ neo4ji create <server name>

destroy the server with the given name

    $ neo4ji destroy <server name>

start the server with the given name (a new server will be created if none exists)

    $ neo4ji start <server name>

stop the server with the given name

    $ neo4ji stop <server name>

show a list of instances managed by noe4ji

    $ neo4ji instances


The module has the following functions:

    var neo4ji = require('neo4ji')

    //create a server instance called testServer
    neo4ji.create('testServer');

    //start the testServer instance
    neo4ji.start('testServer');

    //get the instances object
    var instances = neo4ji.instances();

    //get a graph server instance for testServer
    var graph = neo4ji.instance('testServer');

    //stop the testServer instance
    neo4ji.stop('testServer');

    //destroy the testServer instance
    neo4ji.destroy('testServer');

**Notes on behavior**

- calling <code>create</code> will always create a new instance, overwriting any existing instance
- calling <code>start</code> will create an instance if none exists
- everything is done synchronously
- the initial usage of the command line tool or the module will fetch the neo4j tarball from neo4j.org, so it may take a while
- calling <code>neo4ji.instance()</code> calls <code>start</code>, so it is garonteed to return an initialized instance
- <code>neo4ji.instance()</code> creates an instance of a [node-neo4j](https://github.com/thingdom/node-neo4j) database object
